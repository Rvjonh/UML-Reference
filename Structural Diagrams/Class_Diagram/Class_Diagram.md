# Class Diagram

It's the most used, beacuse the utility or popularity of Object Oriented Programming OOP.
It's used to represent the objects through class, which will have attributes and methods to describe the instance of the object.

Besides this definition, Class Diagrams can (most) used 3 types of relationships:

1. Asociation, which represents type of relation with another objects (classes)
2. inherentence, which allows pass all data from class to another and expand it or modify it
3. Agregation, which allows integrate class inside others classes to used as way of abstraction
